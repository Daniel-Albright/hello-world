# hello-world
My first repository

Salutations.

Daniel is my given moniker. 
My hobby's include video games, minding the business of others, and consuming vast amounts of information daily.
I've started down the path of coding to explore the man-made powers of creation and creativity (all from a keyboard).
I wish to harness this power for my own amusement and employment.
My journey of coding tutorials begins as of 11/10/2019. (Age: 17)
Wish me luck, as I will need it.
<!-----This is pretty embarassing to read 2 weeks in the future, but I'm keeping it as it is what I decided to write at the time and, as stated, is my first repository. Bear with it, as I have decided to do.----->
